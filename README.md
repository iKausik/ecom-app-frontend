## Reflection

### What was the context for this project?

This was a 3 months long project built during May 2021 to Aug 2021. Project goals included building a simple yet extraordinary e-commerce web app using technologies like JavaScript, Node and React.

### What did you set out to build?

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to shop nike sneakers with a pleasant user experience and a easy payment experience using stripe. I started this process by building the API-Backend using `Node` & `ExpressJS` and using the `create-react-app` boilerplate for the frontend.

### Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into OAuth, Auth0, JWT and many more things. But due to project time constraints, I finally decided to use JWT authentication system as of now.

### Conclusion

At the end of the day, it was a great experience building the project, I had to learn plenty of new things, although I build it for my portfolio, it's almost a 90% production-grade application which can be put into live for public with a few tweak. In the next iteration I plan to clean some code and restructure the codebase.
